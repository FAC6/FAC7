This will take place on week 2

We can only start planning this week properly once we ourselves have had experience of doing TDD on real life projects and on our own work. So plan this week in dec/jan potentially. can't really plan something we haven't done.

pre week home work:

## Monday:
### Front End testing
  * 10-11:30 Morning challenge test the functions yesterdays morning challenge
  
### learning objectives
#### Qunit
    * Study the QUnit assertions - which ones did you find most useful? 
    * Read documentation
  
#### Synchronous and asynchronous testing
    * What is this
    * find examples using Qunit
    * Qunit callbacks (hint) ;)
  
#### What is TDD
    * TDD life cycle
    * Red Green Refactor (Why is this useful)
    
  
#### Unit and Integration Testing
    * What are the differnces
    * Continous integration 
    * What are the pros and cons

## Tuesday:
workshop on front end tests
  * 10-11:30 functional programming morning challenge 
  * 11:30-13 intro to TDD and QUnit with example, how to set up, see simpletests.html.
  * 14-18 [Vending Machine](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tdd), this is alot of time can we add anyting extra?. 



 
## Wednesday:
  10-11:30 fix our failing tests morning challenge, to show the value of TDD, still need to write.   
  11:30 introduce the stopwatch. The idea is to follow the TDD cycle to create a stop watch, using ping pong.  
  Split into your groups of 4. Then pair up within that group.   
  * Both pairs write tests which fail  
  * pass them onto the other pair which makes them pass.  
  * follow tutorial with this ping/pong format.   
  * great project with TDD ingrained into there brain!!!!  
  * stretch goals, countdown timer, split timmer, any other functionality eg, translator.  
  * Add as much functionality as you like! you can go your own way  

## Thursday:  
  Carry On!!!
  
## Normal Friday Structure
  * Code Review
  * Respond to Issues
  * Stop Go Continue
  * Presentations
