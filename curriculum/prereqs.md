# Pre-course

Gethin(jumped ship), Huw, Jack and Katerina's prototype for FAC7 onwards pre-reqs and pre-course structure.

### Why do we have pre-requisites for a course aimed at beginners?
We think there are some amazing free resources out there for learning basic programming online. In general, programming languages take a while to get the hang of. We feel that once you've grasped these initial concepts we can quickly build on this and teach you the skills you'll need to work as a full time developer.

# Application pre-requisites structure

## Pre-requisites

We've chosen these resources as our application criteria. If you’re not comfortable coding at this standard by the time the course starts you may struggle. These tasks are part of how we’ll measure whether you're a good candidate for the course as well as whether you can learn in the collaborative environment here.

#### Complete Beginners

If you are completely new to coding, run through these Codecademy tracks first (in this order).
* [HTML & CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web)
* [Make a Website](https://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-a-website)
* [Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript)
* [Make an Interactive Website](https://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-an-interactive-website) (?? find a better one)
* [YouTube API](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/youtube)

We're not looking for a row of 100% completed tracks, if you've studied this before you can skip sections but you will need to understand the full content above.

After those tracks, run through [CSS Diner](http://flukeout.github.io/) (we love this!), to reinforce CSS selectors.

#### Codewars
We want you to reach at least **5kyu**. This is going to take a minimum of 3 weeks and more likely a few months depending on how much time you can spend working on it.  

It takes a while to get the hang of Codewars (it's quite different to and a jump up from Codecademy). We've written our own guide to Codecademy and Codewars [here](https://github.com/codingforeveryone/learning-with-codewars-and-codecademy), which will help you on your way.

You might feel like you need more preparation. If so, take a look at chapters 1-4 of [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent_JavaScript.pdf).  It's helpful for understanding functions and their uses in Javascript and builds nicely on where Codecademy ends.

// find a video for understanding functions to bridge gap

If you find yourself struggling or want to meet other learners, come along to our Monday evening meetups where we can help. We also run Coding for Women on every other Tuesday.  

??and write at least one kata.

Finally, sign up to Stack Overflow and look at some answers given for Javascript questions. The community can be a little intolerant of duplicated questions, so we'll brief on the techniques for asking questions when you arrive. Come join our Gitter channel where we chat about Codewars, Codecademy and other learning resources.

### Recommended
We won't judge you as a candidate on these grounds, and they are not completely necessary, but they will put you in a better place for the course.

Codecademy tracks we would recommend:
* [Regex](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-intermediate-en-NJ7Lr/0/1)
* [Recursion](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-lesson-205/0/1)

It would help greatly for you to be a relatively quick typist. [Typing Club](https://www.typingclub.com/) is good (and free).

Learn some hotkeys on your computer. It will help with switching between programs on your computer, using your browser efficiently and so on.

-hotkey cheat sheets (we need to write them)

Reading [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent_JavaScript.pdf) is a good idea, but it can get heavy after Chapter 4, so don't worry if you find it difficult as it will start to make sense during the course. [Javascript: The Good Parts](http://bdcampbell.net/javascript/book/javascript_the_good_parts.pdf) is written by the God of Javascript, Douglas Crockford, but the diagrams are difficult to follow and it gets equally heavy as Eloquent.

Watch parts 2 and 3 of [Crockford on JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg&list=PL7664379246A246CB). A wonderful series of lectures by the same Crockford as above. A panoramic overview of JavaScript at an advanced level. These two talks are hard to follow, but anything you can take from them is valuable.

### Extras
If you have some spare time, or fancy a break from Codewars, these resources are just for fun!

#### Reading
[Paul Ford - What is Code?](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/) is a great article about his impression of the tech industry and the life of a programmer. It's long, but quite light to read.

[Steve Yegge's Google platforms rant](https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX) shows you how passionate someone can be about their tech company's philosophy.

#### Watching
[Inventing on Principle](https://vimeo.com/36579366), a talk by Bret Victor.

[Computer Science: Past, Present, and Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Tk09c0FQ3M&feature=youtu.be), a talk by Ed Lazowska.

[The Future Doesn't Have to Be Incremental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTAghAJcO1o&feature=youtu.be), a talk by Alan Kay.

Anything with Douglas Crockford in!
