## Pre-course

Gethin, Huw, Jack and Katerina's prototype for FAC7 onwards pre-reqs and pre-course structure.

## Application pre-requisites structure

### Pre-requisites
If you’re not as this standard by the time the course starts you will struggle. These tasks are predominantly how we’ll measure you as a candidate for the course.

If you are new to coding, run through these Codecademy tracks first (in this order):
* [HTML & CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web)
* [Make a Website](https://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-a-website)
* [Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript)
* [Make an Interactive Website](https://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-an-interactive-website) (?? find a better one)
* [YouTube API](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/youtube)

If you've done HTML and CSS before, don't worry about running through that track because you may already know the content.

After those tracks, run through [CSS Diner](http://flukeout.github.io/) (we love this!), to reinforce CSS selectors.

Before going onto Codewars to train your Javascript skills, which is a jump up from Codecademy, read chapters 1-4 of [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent_JavaScript.pdf). It's helpful for understanding functions and their uses in Javascript. We've written our own guide to Codecademy and Codewars [here](https://github.com/codingforeveryone/learning-with-codewars-and-codecademy), which will hopefully help you on your way.

// find a video for understanding functions to bridge gap

After that, you should be ready for having a go at Codewars. If you find yourself struggling, come along to our Monday evening meetups where we can help. We also run Coding for Women on every other Tuesday.  

On Codewars, you will need to reach 5th kyu before the start of the course, and write at least one kata.

Finally, sign up to Stack Overflow and look at some answers given for Javascript questions. The community can be a little intolerant of duplicated questions, so we'll brief on the techniques for asking questions when you arrive. Come join our Gitter channel where we chat about Codewars, Codecademy and other learning resources.

### Recommended
We won't judge you as a candidate on these grounds, and they are not completely necessary, but they will put you in a better place for the course.

Codecademy tracks we would recommend:
* [Regex](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-intermediate-en-NJ7Lr/0/1)
* [Recursion](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-lesson-205/0/1)

It would help greatly for you to be a relatively quick typist. [Typing Club](https://www.typingclub.com/) is good (and free).

Learn some hotkeys on your computer. It will help with switching between programs on your computer, using your browser efficiently and so on.

Reading [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent_JavaScript.pdf) is a good idea, but it can get heavy after Chapter 4, so don't worry if you find it difficult as it will start to make sense during the course. [Javascript: The Good Parts](http://bdcampbell.net/javascript/book/javascript_the_good_parts.pdf) is written by the God of Javascript, Douglas Crockford, but the diagrams are difficult to follow and it gets equally heavy as Eloquent.

Watch parts 2 and 3 of [Crockford on JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg&list=PL7664379246A246CB). A wonderful series of lectures by the same Crockford as above. A panoramic overview of JavaScript at an advanced level. These two talks are hard to follow, but anything you can take from them is valuable.

### Extras
If you have some spare time, or fancy a break from Codewars, these resources are just for fun!

#### Reading
[Paul Ford - What is Code?](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/) is a great article about his impression of the tech industry and the life of a programmer. It's long, but quite light to read.

[Steve Yegge's Google platforms rant](https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX) shows you how passionate someone can be about their tech company's philosophy.

#### Watching
[Inventing on Principle](https://vimeo.com/36579366), a talk by Bret Victor.

[Computer Science: Past, Present, and Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Tk09c0FQ3M&feature=youtu.be), a talk by Ed Lazowska.

[The Future Doesn't Have to Be Incremental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTAghAJcO1o&feature=youtu.be), a talk by Alan Kay.

Anything with Douglas Crockford in!
