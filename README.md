# FAC7 curriculum planning

The plan is for us to go through each week in turn, starting with the pre-course period and ending with Week 7. Use GitHub issues to take notes.

This repo should serve as a prototype to the FAC7 book so should be structured as so.

## Course content planning
For each week in turn, outline the following:
+ Topic for the week
+ Learning goals: what questions do I need to be able to answer?
+ Research topics - for in-depth group study
+ Challenges - short topics
+ workshop(s) - longer topics
+ Project for the week
+ Talk/lecture topics

## Week by week review
+ 10 mins in pairs
+ 10 mins in pairs of pairs
+ 10 mins whole class

In each case, one person to take notes and leave a comment on the relevant issue.

After open discussions, write the prototypal week structure in the curriculum folder.
