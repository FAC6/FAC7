## Tuesday:
### Front End testing
  * 10-11:30 Morning challenge test the functions yesterdays morning challenge
  
### learning objectives
#### Qunit
    * Study the QUnit assertions - which ones did you find most useful? 
    * Read documentation
  
#### Synchronous and asynchronous testing
    * What is this
    * find examples using Qunit
    * Qunit callbacks (hint) ;)
  
#### What is TDD
    * TDD life cycle
    * Red Green Refactor (Why is this useful)
    
  
#### Unit and Integration Testing
    * What are the differnces
    * Continous integration 
    * What are the pros and cons

 
## Wednesday:
  10-11:30 fix our failing tests morning challenge, to show the value of TDD
  11:30 introduce the stopwatch. The idea is to follow the TDD cycle to create a stop watch, using ping pong.
  Split into your groups of 4. Then pair up within that group. 
    * Both pairs write tests which fail 
    * pass them onto the other pair which makes them pass.
    * follow tutorial with this ping/pong format. 
    * great project with TDD ingrained into there brain!!!!
    * Add as much functionality as you like!
